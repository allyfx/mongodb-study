Since you already made your new repository with the template, in Visual Studio Code run the `yarn` command to download all dependencies, after that you're free to code!

The `index.ts` and `README.md` files are free to delete and update according with your project.

## ðŸ“‹ What is it?

It is a template for your Node.js projects using Typescript. It has the Eslint configurations, also has Prettier and Editor Config configured so you don't need to configure them yourself.
